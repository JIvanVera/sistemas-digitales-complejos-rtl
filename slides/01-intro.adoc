* **2021–2022** → Leading RTL Research Engineer @ BSC  
* **2017–2020** → FPGA Engineer @ BITEC-DSP  
* **2013–2016** → Embedded System Engineer @ EnSilica


== Skills

[%step]
* **RTL Design** → SystemVerilog, Verilog  
* **FPGA/ASIC** → Synthesis, CDC, Resets, FIFOs  
* **Embedded SW** → SoCs, HW/SW integration  
* **Leadership & Research** → team & academic projects

== Module Overview

[%step]
1. **Resets & Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)**  
   → Sync vs Async resets, CDC design patterns, demos  

[%step]
2. **Asynchronous FIFO**  
   → Fundamentals, simulation & synthesis, real examples  

[%step]
3. **PDK & Memory Macros**  
   → From generic RAM to PDK macros (*pulp-platform/croc*)


== Teaching Approach

[%step]
* **Practical-first**: theory → real code  
* Live demos: terminal + EDA Playground  
* Students encouraged to **ask & try**


== Goals

By the end of this module you will:

== Goals

By the end of this module you will:

[%step]
* Recognize the importance of **resets** and **CDC** in reliable RTL design  
* Understand the **basic principles** of asynchronous FIFOs  
* Be aware of how **technology-specific memories** are integrated in practice  
* Gain the ability to **identify CDC/Reset/Memory issues** and know how to find the right techniques to solve them
