= Lab 3 â€” 2-FF reset synchronizer: async assert, sync release

Goal: Fix async deassertion with a 2-FF synchronizer.
Both counters exit reset aligned to the clock, 2 cycles after external release.

== Observe in EPWave

* ext_rst_n deasserts at 49.5 ns (like Lab 2).

* mrst_n (synchronizer output) goes high after 2 clock edges.

* Both q0/q1 start in sync.
