= Lab 4 — Multi-clock: per-domain synchronizers vs sequenced release

== Goal:

* Independent: one synchronizer per clock domain → each exits when ready.

* Sequenced: domain B waits for domain A to be out of reset.

== Observe in EPWave

* Independent: mrstA_n and mrstB_n rise at different times (clock-dependent).

* Sequenced: mrstB_n won’t rise until mrstA_n is high (then 2 clkB edges).
