Lab 1 — Synchronous reset & pulse stretcher

Goal: Show that a short reset pulse can be missed with synchronous reset if it doesn’t align with a clock edge, and how a stretcher fixes it by holding reset for N cycles.

Observe in EPWave

rst_n_glitch: 4 ns low between clock edges → direct counter does not reset.

rst_n_stretched: stretcher holds reset 3 cycles → stretched counter does reset.

Compare q_direct vs q_str.
